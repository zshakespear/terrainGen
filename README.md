# terrainGen

The purpose of this code is to allow the user to generate terrain for hex maps.
The user will input the seed biome and the program will traverse the terrain
and return a map in a txt file.

The hex.py file creates the base object while the hexgen file uses the hex object
to traverse the terrain.
